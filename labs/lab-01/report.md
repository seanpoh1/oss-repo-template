Suggestions on how to answer questions in a helpful way

Determine if who you're asking is suitable to answer your question. Asking fellow students for help with explaining difficult class topics may not be as helpful as asking the professor teaching the class, whereas asking the professor if there is any homework due will definitely prove to be a waste of time on both your part and the professors.

Give context to the question you are asking. Sometimes asking questions without giving the context of the problem simply just causes the question to be too hard to grasp and understand, causing them to be unable to help.


Free Culture

Reading the chapter of a student that attended a school I am all too familiar with, being falsefully accused of promoting piracy simply because of his brilliant mind and ideas, and the audacity of the RIAA to go after and threaten students, who have not even entered the workplace, some of which are even in their teens, makes me unspeakably angry at the injustice that they have faced. It showcases the faults in the American justice system, where even if a person was innocent, to achieve this innocence in court would require so much money it would destroy their lives in the process. A giant company pressuring college students, sueing them, and threatening them, should never be acceptable practice in any circumstances, especially if the students have not done any real harm. But the real loss here was for the field of technology, if the student had not been threatened, sued, and been so betrayed by society, this young man could have contributed so much to the progress of this field, untouched by the corruption and failings of society. In the end, what is undeniable is that something has to change in order for this to never happen again. The question of what should be changed, however, is not simple, as this has things to do with the areas of law and morality.
