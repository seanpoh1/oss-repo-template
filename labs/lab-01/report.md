Suggestions on how to answer questions in a helpful way

Determine if who you're asking is suitable to answer your question. Asking fellow students for help with explaining difficult class topics may not be as helpful as asking the professor teaching the class, whereas asking the professor if there is any homework due will definitely prove to be a waste of time on both your part and the professors.

Give context to the question you are asking. Sometimes asking questions without giving the context of the problem simply just causes the question to be too hard to grasp and understand, causing them to be unable to help.
