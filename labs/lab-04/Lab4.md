##### Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?

A license protects the creator's work from being stolen, or misused for unintended purposes, giving control to the creator on how others can use or modify their work. But a license also allows users to use the work given and modify it with permission (if given), under the terms of the license that is used for the given work.



##### Why is it important you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

If a project does not have an explicit license, you therefore cannot be certain that you were given permission to use or modify said project for your own personal goals. Even if the creator meant for people to use his work, if not given explicit permission through a license, it remains risky to use such a project.





##### My views on the "Failure to follow the Open System Model" Section of [Why the Web beat Gopher](http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain).

In the reading that was given, the section explains why Gopher's closed development style became a leading factor in its defeat by the Web development team. I agree that because of a decision Gopher's team had made, it caused its popularity to drop immensely amongst developers. If Gopher had allowed the public to have a say in its directions and decisions, perhaps such a thing would not have happened.



##### Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. 

##### Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? 

Microsoft .NET Core uses the MIT license, which is a license that allows one to do almost anything with the software as long as the original copyright and license notice is included in the project using it. Microsoft .NET is a free software created to allow developers to build more software, and the use of the MIT license is logical, as it is simple to understand, and has few restrictions on the usage of the licensed software. Given the goals of the Microsoft .NET software, having easy to understand and easy to follow rules was, and still is, a necessity for its popularity and growth.

 

##### As a table, make up an open source project and a ***business model*** that you could use to make money from it.

##### Take 5 projects from [Observatory](http://rcos.io/projects) or [past RCOS Projects](https://rcos.io/projects/past) and create a table for which project has which license. for example:

| Website                 | License Present | License     |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| DormDesign              | Yes             | MIT License |
| PersonalWebsiteTemplate | Yes             | MIT License |
| RaidTA                  | Yes             | MIT License |
| TutorBase               | Yes             | MIT License |
| YACS                    | Yes             | MIT License |
